# PSD-I Study Guide

## Section 1: Scrum Framework

### Question 1: Scrum Definition
**What is Scrum?**

a) A project management methodology  
b) A lightweight framework for developing, delivering, and sustaining complex products  
c) A software development tool  
d) A comprehensive process for software development  

**Correct Answer:** b) A lightweight framework for developing, delivering, and sustaining complex products

**Explanation:**  
Scrum is not a methodology or process, but rather a lightweight framework that helps people, teams, and organizations generate value through adaptive solutions for complex problems. It provides a simple structure that allows teams to self-organize and make changes quickly in accordance with Agile principles. The framework is intentionally incomplete, defining only the parts required to implement Scrum theory.

### Question 2: Scrum Theory Foundation
**Which theory is Scrum founded upon?**

a) Systems Theory  
b) Empiricism and Lean Thinking  
c) Waterfall Theory  
d) Chaos Theory  

**Correct Answer:** b) Empiricism and Lean Thinking

**Explanation:**  
Scrum is founded on empiricism and lean thinking. Empiricism asserts that knowledge comes from experience and making decisions based on what is observed. Lean thinking reduces waste and focuses on the essentials. Scrum employs an iterative, incremental approach to optimize predictability and control risk. Together, these foundational theories help teams deliver value incrementally while continuously inspecting and adapting their approach.

---

### Question 3: Scrum Pillars
**What are the three pillars of Scrum?**

a) Planning, Execution, Review  
b) Transparency, Inspection, Adaptation  
c) People, Process, Technology  
d) Requirements, Design, Testing  

**Correct Answer:** b) Transparency, Inspection, Adaptation

**Explanation:**  
The three pillars that uphold Scrum are Transparency (the emergent process and work must be visible), Inspection (the Scrum artifacts and progress must be inspected frequently), and Adaptation (if any aspects deviate outside acceptable limits, adjustments must be made). These pillars work together to ensure that Scrum Teams can effectively manage complex work while continuously improving their processes and products.

---

### Question 4: Scrum Values
**Which of the following is NOT one of the five Scrum values?**

a) Commitment  
b) Focus  
c) Efficiency  
d) Respect  

**Correct Answer:** c) Efficiency

**Explanation:**  
The five Scrum values are Commitment, Focus, Openness, Respect, and Courage. While efficiency is desirable, it is not one of the official Scrum values. These values give direction to the Scrum Team with regard to their work, actions, and behavior. When these values are embodied by the Scrum Team and the people they work with, the empirical Scrum pillars of transparency, inspection, and adaptation come to life, building trust.

---

### Question 5: Scrum Team Size
**What is the recommended size for a Scrum Team?**

a) 5 or fewer people  
b) 10 or fewer people  
c) 15 or fewer people  
d) Any size that works  

**Correct Answer:** b) 10 or fewer people

**Explanation:**  
The Scrum Guide recommends that a Scrum Team should typically be 10 or fewer people. This size is small enough to remain nimble and large enough to complete significant work within a Sprint. If Scrum Teams become too large, they should consider reorganizing into multiple cohesive Scrum Teams, each focused on the same product. The smaller team size facilitates better communication, collaboration, and accountability.

---

### Question 6: Product Owner Accountability
**What is the Product Owner accountable for?**

a) Managing the Scrum Team  
b) Maximizing the value of the product resulting from the work of the Scrum Team  
c) Ensuring all meetings are attended  
d) Writing all code  

**Correct Answer:** b) Maximizing the value of the product resulting from the work of the Scrum Team

**Explanation:**  
The Product Owner is accountable for maximizing the value of the product resulting from the work of the Scrum Team. They are also accountable for effective Product Backlog management, which includes developing and explicitly communicating the Product Goal, creating and clearly communicating Product Backlog items, ordering Product Backlog items, and ensuring that the Product Backlog is transparent, visible, and understood. The Product Owner is one person, not a committee.

---

### Question 7: Developers Accountability
**What are the Developers accountable for?**

a) Only writing code  
b) Creating a plan for the Sprint, the Sprint Backlog  
c) Testing the product  
d) Managing stakeholders  

**Correct Answer:** b) Creating a plan for the Sprint, the Sprint Backlog

**Explanation:**  
Developers are accountable for creating a plan for the Sprint (the Sprint Backlog), instilling quality by adhering to a Definition of Done, adapting their plan each day toward the Sprint Goal, and holding each other accountable as professionals. The term "Developers" refers to anyone working on creating any aspect of a usable Increment each Sprint, not just programmers. They are self-managing and decide how to turn Product Backlog items into Increments of value.

---

### Question 8: Scrum Master Role
**What is the primary accountability of the Scrum Master?**

a) Managing the team's daily activities  
b) Establishing Scrum as defined in the Scrum Guide  
c) Writing user stories  
d) Reporting to management  

**Correct Answer:** b) Establishing Scrum as defined in the Scrum Guide

**Explanation:**  
The Scrum Master is accountable for establishing Scrum as defined in the Scrum Guide. They do this by helping everyone understand Scrum theory and practice, both within the Scrum Team and the organization. The Scrum Master is accountable for the Scrum Team's effectiveness by enabling the Scrum Team to improve its practices within the Scrum framework. They serve the Scrum Team, the Product Owner, and the organization in various ways.

---

### Question 9: Sprint Duration
**What is the maximum duration of a Sprint?**

a) 2 weeks  
b) 1 month  
c) 6 weeks  
d) No maximum  

**Correct Answer:** b) 1 month

**Explanation:**  
Sprints are the heartbeat of Scrum, where ideas are turned into value. They are fixed-length events of one month or less to create consistency. A new Sprint starts immediately after the conclusion of the previous Sprint. Sprints that are too long may allow the Sprint Goal to become invalid, increase complexity, and increase risk. Shorter Sprints can be employed to generate more learning cycles and limit risk of cost and effort to a smaller time frame.

---

### Question 10: Sprint Goal
**Who is responsible for crafting the Sprint Goal?**

a) Product Owner only  
b) Scrum Master only  
c) The entire Scrum Team  
d) Developers only  

**Correct Answer:** c) The entire Scrum Team

**Explanation:**  
The Sprint Goal is crafted by the entire Scrum Team during Sprint Planning. It is the single objective for the Sprint that provides guidance to the Developers on why they are building the Increment. The Sprint Goal creates coherence and focus, encouraging the Scrum Team to work together rather than on separate initiatives. If the work turns out to be different than expected, the Developers collaborate with the Product Owner to negotiate the scope of the Sprint Backlog within the Sprint without affecting the Sprint Goal.

---

### Question 11: Daily Scrum Purpose
**What is the purpose of the Daily Scrum?**

a) To report status to the Scrum Master  
b) To inspect progress toward the Sprint Goal and adapt the Sprint Backlog as necessary  
c) To assign tasks for the day  
d) To review completed work  

**Correct Answer:** b) To inspect progress toward the Sprint Goal and adapt the Sprint Backlog as necessary

**Explanation:**  
The purpose of the Daily Scrum is to inspect progress toward the Sprint Goal and adapt the Sprint Backlog as necessary, adjusting the upcoming planned work. It is a 15-minute event for the Developers of the Scrum Team held at the same time and place every working day of the Sprint. The Daily Scrum improves communications, identifies impediments, promotes quick decision-making, and consequently eliminates the need for other meetings.

---

### Question 12: Sprint Review
**What happens during the Sprint Review?**

a) The Scrum Team presents completed work to stakeholders and collaborates on what to do next  
b) The Scrum Master reviews the team's performance  
c) Only the Product Owner presents the work  
d) The team plans the next Sprint  

**Correct Answer:** a) The Scrum Team presents completed work to stakeholders and collaborates on what to do next

**Explanation:**  
During the Sprint Review, the Scrum Team presents the results of their work to key stakeholders and progress toward the Product Goal is discussed. The Scrum Team and stakeholders review what was accomplished in the Sprint and what has changed in their environment. Based on this information, attendees collaborate on what to do next. The Product Backlog may also be adjusted to meet new opportunities. The Sprint Review is a working session and should not be limited to a presentation.

---

### Question 13: Sprint Retrospective
**What is the purpose of the Sprint Retrospective?**

a) To review the product increment  
b) To plan ways to increase quality and effectiveness  
c) To assign blame for problems  
d) To report to stakeholders  

**Correct Answer:** b) To plan ways to increase quality and effectiveness

**Explanation:**  
The purpose of the Sprint Retrospective is to plan ways to increase quality and effectiveness. The Scrum Team inspects how the last Sprint went with regards to individuals, interactions, processes, tools, and their Definition of Done. The team identifies the most helpful changes to improve its effectiveness, and the most impactful improvements are addressed as soon as possible. The Sprint Retrospective concludes the Sprint and is timeboxed to a maximum of three hours for a one-month Sprint.

---

### Question 14: Product Backlog
**What is the Product Backlog?**

a) A list of tasks for the current Sprint  
b) An emergent, ordered list of what is needed to improve the product  
c) A requirements document  
d) A bug tracking list  

**Correct Answer:** b) An emergent, ordered list of what is needed to improve the product

**Explanation:**  
The Product Backlog is an emergent, ordered list of what is needed to improve the product. It is the single source of work undertaken by the Scrum Team. Product Backlog items that can be Done by the Scrum Team within one Sprint are deemed ready for selection in a Sprint Planning event. The Product Backlog is never complete and evolves as the product and the environment in which it will be used evolves. Product Backlog refinement is the act of breaking down and further defining Product Backlog items.

---

### Question 15: Sprint Backlog
**What is the Sprint Backlog?**

a) A subset of the Product Backlog  
b) The Sprint Goal, the selected Product Backlog items, and a plan for delivering them  
c) A list of bugs to fix  
d) Tasks assigned by the Scrum Master  

**Correct Answer:** b) The Sprint Goal, the selected Product Backlog items, and a plan for delivering them

**Explanation:**  
The Sprint Backlog is composed of the Sprint Goal (why), the set of Product Backlog items selected for the Sprint (what), as well as an actionable plan for delivering the Increment (how). It is a plan by and for the Developers. It is a highly visible, real-time picture of the work that the Developers plan to accomplish during the Sprint in order to achieve the Sprint Goal. The Sprint Backlog is updated throughout the Sprint as more is learned.

---

### Question 16: Increment Definition
**What is an Increment?**

a) The sum of all work completed in the current Sprint  
b) A concrete stepping stone toward the Product Goal  
c) A document describing features  
d) A prototype  

**Correct Answer:** b) A concrete stepping stone toward the Product Goal

**Explanation:**  
An Increment is a concrete stepping stone toward the Product Goal. Each Increment is additive to all prior Increments and thoroughly verified, ensuring that all Increments work together. In order to provide value, the Increment must be usable. Multiple Increments may be created within a Sprint, and the sum of the Increments is presented at the Sprint Review. An Increment may be delivered to stakeholders prior to the end of the Sprint, and the Sprint Review should never be considered a gate to releasing value.

---

### Question 17: Definition of Done
**What is the Definition of Done?**

a) A checklist of tasks  
b) A formal description of the state of the Increment when it meets the quality measures required for the product  
c) When the Product Owner says it's done  
d) When all code is written  

**Correct Answer:** b) A formal description of the state of the Increment when it meets the quality measures required for the product

**Explanation:**  
The Definition of Done is a formal description of the state of the Increment when it meets the quality measures required for the product. The moment a Product Backlog item meets the Definition of Done, an Increment is born. It creates transparency by providing everyone a shared understanding of what work was completed as part of the Increment. If a Product Backlog item does not meet the Definition of Done, it cannot be released or even presented at the Sprint Review.

---

### Question 18: Canceling a Sprint
**Who can cancel a Sprint?**

a) The Scrum Master  
b) The Developers  
c) The Product Owner  
d) Any stakeholder  

**Correct Answer:** c) The Product Owner

**Explanation:**  
Only the Product Owner has the authority to cancel a Sprint. A Sprint could be cancelled if the Sprint Goal becomes obsolete. This might occur if the company changes direction or if market or technology conditions change. In general, a Sprint should be cancelled if it no longer makes sense given the circumstances. However, due to the short duration of Sprints, cancellation rarely makes sense. When a Sprint is cancelled, any completed and "Done" Product Backlog items are reviewed and potentially released.

---

### Question 19: Self-Management
**What does it mean for a Scrum Team to be self-managing?**

a) They don't need a manager  
b) They internally decide who does what, when, and how  
c) They work without any guidance  
d) They report only to themselves  

**Correct Answer:** b) They internally decide who does what, when, and how

**Explanation:**  
Self-managing means that the Scrum Team internally decides who does what, when, and how. The team members choose how best to accomplish their work rather than being directed by others outside the team. This doesn't mean they work in isolation or without accountability - they still collaborate with stakeholders and align with organizational goals. Self-management empowers teams to organize around the work and make decisions that optimize their effectiveness, leading to better outcomes and higher engagement.

---

### Question 20: Product Goal
**What is the Product Goal?**

a) The objective for the current Sprint  
b) The long-term objective for the Scrum Team that is in the Product Backlog  
c) A list of features  
d) The release plan  

**Correct Answer:** b) The long-term objective for the Scrum Team that is in the Product Backlog

**Explanation:**  
The Product Goal describes a future state of the product which can serve as a target for the Scrum Team to plan against. It is the long-term objective for the Scrum Team and is in the Product Backlog. The rest of the Product Backlog emerges to define "what" will fulfill the Product Goal. The Scrum Team must fulfill (or abandon) one objective before taking on the next. The Product Goal is a commitment for the Product Backlog, providing focus and a target for the team.

---

### Question 21: Scrum Events Container
**All Scrum events are contained within what?**

a) The Product Backlog  
b) The Sprint  
c) The Release Plan  
d) The Project Timeline  

**Correct Answer:** b) The Sprint

**Explanation:**  
The Sprint is the container for all other Scrum events. Sprint Planning, Daily Scrums, Sprint Review, and Sprint Retrospective all occur within the Sprint. Each Sprint is a fixed-length event of one month or less that serves as a container for the other events, ensuring consistency and creating a rhythm for the Scrum Team. This container approach helps maintain focus and provides regular opportunities for inspection and adaptation throughout the development process.

---

### Question 22: Transparency in Scrum
**What must be transparent in Scrum?**

a) Only the Product Backlog  
b) The emergent process and work  
c) Individual performance metrics  
d) Salary information  

**Correct Answer:** b) The emergent process and work

**Explanation:**  
In Scrum, the emergent process and work must be visible to those performing the work as well as those receiving the work. With Scrum, important decisions are based on the perceived state of its three formal artifacts. Low transparency can lead to decisions that diminish value and increase risk. Transparency enables inspection, and without transparency, inspection is misleading and wasteful. Transparency requires those aspects be defined by a shared understanding and standard, which is supported by the Definition of Done.

---

### Question 23: Inspection Frequency
**How frequently should Scrum artifacts and progress be inspected?**

a) Only at the end of the Sprint  
b) Frequently and diligently  
c) Once a month  
d) Only when problems occur  

**Correct Answer:** b) Frequently and diligently

**Explanation:**  
Scrum artifacts and the progress toward agreed goals must be inspected frequently and diligently to detect potentially undesirable variances or problems. To help with inspection, Scrum provides cadence in the form of its five events. However, inspection without adaptation is considered pointless. Scrum events are designed to provoke change and enable inspection. Frequent inspection helps teams identify issues early and make timely adjustments, ensuring continuous improvement and alignment with goals.

---

### Question 24: Adaptation Timing
**When should adaptation occur in Scrum?**

a) Only during the Sprint Retrospective  
b) As soon as a problem is discovered  
c) At the end of the project  
d) When management requests it  

**Correct Answer:** b) As soon as a problem is discovered

**Explanation:**  
If any aspects of a process deviate outside acceptable limits or if the resulting product is unacceptable, the process being applied or the materials being produced must be adjusted as soon as possible to minimize further deviation. Adaptation becomes more difficult when the people involved are not empowered or self-managing. A Scrum Team is expected to adapt the moment it learns anything new through inspection. The Scrum events provide formal opportunities for adaptation, but it can happen at any time.

---

### Question 25: Scrum Master Service to Product Owner
**How does the Scrum Master serve the Product Owner?**

a) By making all product decisions  
b) By helping find techniques for effective Product Goal definition and Product Backlog management  
c) By writing user stories  
d) By prioritizing the Product Backlog  

**Correct Answer:** b) By helping find techniques for effective Product Goal definition and Product Backlog management

**Explanation:**  
The Scrum Master serves the Product Owner in several ways including helping find techniques for effective Product Goal definition and Product Backlog management, helping the Scrum Team understand the need for clear and concise Product Backlog items, helping establish empirical product planning for a complex environment, and facilitating stakeholder collaboration as requested or needed. The Scrum Master does not make product decisions or prioritize work - those remain the Product Owner's accountability.

---

### Question 26: Scrum Master Service to Developers
**How does the Scrum Master serve the Developers?**

a) By assigning tasks to team members  
b) By coaching the team in self-management and cross-functionality  
c) By doing technical work  
d) By reporting their progress to management  

**Correct Answer:** b) By coaching the team in self-management and cross-functionality

**Explanation:**  
The Scrum Master serves the Developers in several ways including coaching in self-management and cross-functionality, helping focus on creating high-value Increments that meet the Definition of Done, causing the removal of impediments to the team's progress, and ensuring that all Scrum events take place and are positive, productive, and kept within the timebox. The Scrum Master is a servant-leader who enables the team's success without taking over their responsibilities or decision-making authority.

---

### Question 27: Scrum Master Service to Organization
**How does the Scrum Master serve the organization?**

a) By managing multiple Scrum Teams  
b) By leading, training, and coaching the organization in its Scrum adoption  
c) By reporting team metrics  
d) By enforcing company policies  

**Correct Answer:** b) By leading, training, and coaching the organization in its Scrum adoption

**Explanation:**  
The Scrum Master serves the organization in several ways including leading, training, and coaching the organization in its Scrum adoption, planning and advising Scrum implementations within the organization, helping employees and stakeholders understand and enact an empirical approach for complex work, and removing barriers between stakeholders and Scrum Teams. The Scrum Master helps the broader organization understand and support Scrum, creating an environment where Scrum Teams can thrive and deliver value effectively.

---

### Question 28: Product Backlog Ordering
**Who is responsible for ordering the Product Backlog?**

a) The Scrum Master  
b) The Developers  
c) The Product Owner  
d) The stakeholders  

**Correct Answer:** c) The Product Owner

**Explanation:**  
The Product Owner is responsible for ordering the items in the Product Backlog to best achieve goals and missions. The Product Owner is one person, not a committee, and while they may represent the desires of a committee in the Product Backlog, those wanting to change the Product Backlog can do so by trying to convince the Product Owner. The ordering of Product Backlog items is crucial for maximizing value delivery and ensuring the team works on the most important items first.

---

### Question 29: Sprint Planning Attendees
**Who must attend Sprint Planning?**

a) Only the Product Owner and Scrum Master  
b) The entire Scrum Team  
c) All stakeholders  
d) Only the Developers  

**Correct Answer:** b) The entire Scrum Team

**Explanation:**  
Sprint Planning initiates the Sprint by laying out the work to be performed for the Sprint, and this resulting plan is created by the collaborative work of the entire Scrum Team. The Product Owner ensures that attendees are prepared to discuss the most important Product Backlog items and how they map to the Product Goal. The Scrum Team may also invite other people to attend Sprint Planning to provide advice. All three accountabilities (Product Owner, Scrum Master, and Developers) are essential for effective Sprint Planning.

---

### Question 30: Sprint Planning Timebox
**What is the maximum timebox for Sprint Planning in a one-month Sprint?**

a) 4 hours  
b) 8 hours  
c) 1 day  
d) 2 days  

**Correct Answer:** b) 8 hours

**Explanation:**  
Sprint Planning is timeboxed to a maximum of eight hours for a one-month Sprint. For shorter Sprints, the event is usually shorter. The Scrum Master ensures that the event takes place and that attendants understand its purpose, and teaches the Scrum Team to keep it within the timebox. Sprint Planning addresses three topics: Why is this Sprint valuable (Sprint Goal), What can be Done this Sprint (selected Product Backlog items), and How will the chosen work get done (plan for delivering the Increment).

---

### Question 31: Daily Scrum Timebox
**What is the timebox for the Daily Scrum?**

a) 10 minutes  
b) 15 minutes  
c) 30 minutes  
d) No timebox  

**Correct Answer:** b) 15 minutes

**Explanation:**  
The Daily Scrum is a 15-minute event for the Developers of the Scrum Team. It is held at the same time and place every working day of the Sprint to reduce complexity. If the Product Owner or Scrum Master are actively working on items in the Sprint Backlog, they participate as Developers. The timebox ensures the meeting remains focused and efficient. The Developers can select whatever structure and techniques they want, as long as their Daily Scrum focuses on progress toward the Sprint Goal.

---

### Question 32: Sprint Review Timebox
**What is the maximum timebox for the Sprint Review in a one-month Sprint?**

a) 2 hours  
b) 4 hours  
c) 8 hours  
d) 1 day  

**Correct Answer:** b) 4 hours

**Explanation:**  
The Sprint Review is timeboxed to a maximum of four hours for a one-month Sprint. For shorter Sprints, the event is usually shorter. The purpose is to inspect the outcome of the Sprint and determine future adaptations. The Scrum Team presents the results of their work to key stakeholders and progress toward the Product Goal is discussed. During the event, the Scrum Team and stakeholders review what was accomplished and collaborate on what to do next, potentially adjusting the Product Backlog.

---

### Question 33: Sprint Retrospective Timebox
**What is the maximum timebox for the Sprint Retrospective in a one-month Sprint?**

a) 1 hour  
b) 2 hours  
c) 3 hours  
d) 4 hours  

**Correct Answer:** c) 3 hours

**Explanation:**  
The Sprint Retrospective is timeboxed to a maximum of three hours for a one-month Sprint. For shorter Sprints, the event is usually shorter. The purpose is for the Scrum Team to plan ways to increase quality and effectiveness. The Scrum Team inspects how the last Sprint went with regards to individuals, interactions, processes, tools, and their Definition of Done. The team discusses what went well, what problems were encountered, and how those problems were (or were not) solved, and identifies the most helpful changes to improve effectiveness.

---

### Question 34: Product Owner Decision Authority
**Can others make Product Backlog decisions for the Product Owner?**

a) Yes, if approved by management  
b) Yes, if the Scrum Master agrees  
c) No, for the Product Owner to succeed, the entire organization must respect their decisions  
d) Yes, during Sprint Planning  

**Correct Answer:** c) No, for the Product Owner to succeed, the entire organization must respect their decisions

**Explanation:**  
The Product Owner is one person, not a committee. The Product Owner may represent the needs of many stakeholders in the Product Backlog, but those wanting to change the Product Backlog can do so by trying to convince the Product Owner. For the Product Owner to succeed, the entire organization must respect their decisions, which are visible in the content and ordering of the Product Backlog, and through the inspectable Increment at the Sprint Review. No one can force the Developers to work from a different set of requirements.

---

### Question 35: Developers' Decision-Making
**Who decides how to turn Product Backlog items into Increments of value?**

a) The Product Owner  
b) The Scrum Master  
c) The Developers  
d) Management  

**Correct Answer:** c) The Developers

**Explanation:**  
The Developers decide how to turn Product Backlog items into Increments of value. No one else tells them how to do this - they are self-managing and have the authority to organize and manage their own work. Developers are the people in the Scrum Team that are committed to creating any aspect of a usable Increment each Sprint, regardless of their technical, functional, or other specialty. They are accountable for creating a plan for the Sprint and instilling quality by adhering to a Definition of Done.

---

### Question 36: Product Backlog Items Readiness
**What makes a Product Backlog item ready for selection in Sprint Planning?**

a) It has been assigned story points  
b) It can be Done by the Scrum Team within one Sprint  
c) It has been approved by management  
d) It has detailed documentation  

**Correct Answer:** b) It can be Done by the Scrum Team within one Sprint

**Explanation:**  
Product Backlog items that can be Done by the Scrum Team within one Sprint are deemed ready for selection in a Sprint Planning event. They usually acquire this degree of transparency through refining activities. Product Backlog refinement is the act of breaking down and further defining Product Backlog items into smaller more precise items. This is an ongoing activity to add details such as description, order, and size, though the details, size, and order may vary. The Developers who will be doing the work are responsible for the sizing.

---

### Question 37: Sprint Commitment
**Once a Sprint begins and the Sprint Goal is set, what can be changed?**

a) Nothing can be changed  
b) The Sprint Goal cannot change, but scope may be clarified and renegotiated with the Product Owner  
c) Everything can be changed freely  
d) Only the Product Owner can make changes  

**Correct Answer:** b) The Sprint Goal cannot change, but scope may be clarified and renegotiated with the Product Owner

**Explanation:**  
During the Sprint, no changes are made that would endanger the Sprint Goal. Quality does not decrease. The Product Backlog is refined as needed. Scope may be clarified and renegotiated with the Product Owner as more is learned. The Sprint Goal is the commitment for the Sprint Backlog and provides guidance to the Developers on why they are building the Increment. While the Sprint Goal is fixed during the Sprint, the Sprint Backlog itself can be updated as the team learns more about what is needed.

---

### Question 38: Multiple Scrum Teams
**When multiple Scrum Teams are working on the same product, what must they share?**

a) The same Sprint schedule  
b) The same Product Goal, Product Backlog, and Product Owner  
c) The same Scrum Master  
d) The same office space  

**Correct Answer:** b) The same Product Goal, Product Backlog, and Product Owner

**Explanation:**  
If Scrum Teams are working together on the same product, they must share the same Product Goal, Product Backlog, and Product Owner. They may have different Sprint lengths, different Sprint schedules, and different Scrum Masters. However, to ensure they are building a cohesive product, they need to be working toward the same Product Goal, pulling from the same Product Backlog that is ordered by the same Product Owner. This ensures alignment and helps avoid building contradictory or duplicate functionality.

---

### Question 39: Definition of Done Requirement
**What happens if a Product Backlog item does not meet the Definition of Done?**

a) It can still be released if the Product Owner approves  
b) It cannot be released or presented at the Sprint Review  
c) It counts toward the Sprint Goal  
d) It becomes a bug to fix later  

**Correct Answer:** b) It cannot be released or presented at the Sprint Review

**Explanation:**  
If a Product Backlog item does not meet the Definition of Done, it cannot be released or even presented at the Sprint Review. Instead, it returns to the Product Backlog for future consideration. The Definition of Done creates transparency by providing everyone a shared understanding of what work was completed as part of the Increment. It ensures quality and helps the team maintain a sustainable pace. Without meeting the Definition of Done, work is not considered complete and cannot contribute to delivering value.

---

### Question 40: Increment Usability
**When must an Increment be usable?**

a) At the end of the project  
b) When it meets the Definition of Done  
c) When the Product Owner approves it  
d) After user acceptance testing  

**Correct Answer:** b) When it meets the Definition of Done

**Explanation:**  
An Increment must be usable and meet the Scrum Team's Definition of Done regardless of whether the Product Owner decides to release it. The moment a Product Backlog item meets the Definition of Done, an Increment is born. Multiple Increments may be created within a Sprint, and the sum of the Increments is presented at the Sprint Review. An Increment may be delivered to stakeholders prior to the end of the Sprint, emphasizing that the Sprint Review should never be considered a gate to releasing value.

---

### Question 41: Scrum Adaptations
**Can the Scrum framework be adapted or modified?**

a) Yes, teams can change anything that doesn't work for them  
b) No, Scrum must be implemented exactly as described in the Scrum Guide  
c) Only if approved by Scrum.org  
d) Yes, but only by certified Scrum Masters  

**Correct Answer:** b) No, Scrum must be implemented exactly as described in the Scrum Guide

**Explanation:**  
While Scrum is intentionally incomplete and designed to work within existing processes and practices, the Scrum framework itself is immutable. If you're not doing all of it, you're not doing Scrum. Implementing only parts of Scrum is possible, but then you're not doing Scrum. Scrum exists only in its entirety and functions well as a container for other techniques, methodologies, and practices. The framework is designed as a minimum viable approach - removing elements undermines the empirical foundation that makes Scrum work.

---

### Question 42: Daily Scrum Location
**Where should the Daily Scrum be held?**

a) In the Scrum Master's office  
b) At the same time and place every working day  
c) Wherever the Product Owner decides  
d) It can rotate locations daily  

**Correct Answer:** b) At the same time and place every working day

**Explanation:**  
The Daily Scrum is held at the same time and place every working day of the Sprint to reduce complexity. Consistency in timing and location helps establish a routine and ensures all Developers can attend. This doesn't mean it must be a physical location - for distributed teams, it could be a virtual meeting space. The key is consistency and predictability. If the Product Owner or Scrum Master are actively working on items in the Sprint Backlog, they participate as Developers during the Daily Scrum.

### Question 43: Sprint Review Participants
**Who should attend the Sprint Review?**

a) Only the Scrum Team  
b) The Scrum Team and key stakeholders  
c) Only management  
d) Only the Product Owner and stakeholders  

**Correct Answer:** b) The Scrum Team and key stakeholders

**Explanation:**  
The Sprint Review is attended by the Scrum Team and key stakeholders invited by the Product Owner. During the Sprint Review, the Scrum Team presents the results of their work to stakeholders and progress toward the Product Goal is discussed. The entire Scrum Team (Product Owner, Scrum Master, and Developers) participates, and the attendance of stakeholders is crucial for getting feedback and collaborating on what to do next. This collaboration helps ensure the product is evolving in the right direction and maximizing value.

### Question 44: Forecast in Sprint Planning
**Who is responsible for forecasting which Product Backlog items will be completed in the Sprint?**

a) The Product Owner  
b) The Scrum Master  
c) The Developers  
d) Management  

**Correct Answer:** c) The Developers

**Explanation:**  
The Developers are responsible for forecasting which Product Backlog items they believe they can complete during the Sprint. Only the Developers can assess what they can accomplish, given their understanding of past performance, upcoming Sprint conditions, and their Definition of Done. The Product Owner can help clarify the selected Product Backlog items and make trade-offs, but the Developers have the final say in what they forecast they can turn into an Increment of product during the Sprint.

---

### Question 45: Sprint Backlog Modification
**Who can modify the Sprint Backlog during a Sprint?**

a) Only the Scrum Master  
b) Only the Product Owner  
c) Only the Developers  
d) Anyone on the Scrum Team  

**Correct Answer:** c) Only the Developers

**Explanation:**  
The Sprint Backlog is owned by the Developers, and only they can modify it during a Sprint. As the Developers work, they keep the Sprint Goal in mind and may add, remove, or modify planned work as they learn more. The Sprint Backlog is updated throughout the Sprint as more is learned. It is a highly visible, real-time picture of the work that the Developers plan to accomplish during the Sprint. While scope may be clarified and renegotiated with the Product Owner, the Developers have the authority to manage their Sprint Backlog.

### Question 46: Empiricism in Scrum
**What does empiricism mean in the context of Scrum?**

a) Following a detailed plan  
b) Knowledge comes from experience and making decisions based on what is observed  
c) Using past project data exclusively  
d) Predicting all outcomes in advance  

**Correct Answer:** b) Knowledge comes from experience and making decisions based on what is observed

**Explanation:**  
Empiricism asserts that knowledge comes from experience and making decisions based on what is observed. Scrum employs an iterative, incremental approach to optimize predictability and to control risk. Rather than trying to predict and plan everything upfront (which is impossible for complex work), empirical process control embraces the reality that the problem and solution are not fully understood at the start. Through transparency, inspection, and adaptation, teams learn and adjust as they go, making decisions based on actual observations rather than speculation.

---

### Question 47: Lean Thinking in Scrum
**What does lean thinking emphasize in Scrum?**

a) Comprehensive documentation  
b) Reducing waste and focusing on the essentials  
c) Adding more process controls  
d) Expanding team size  

**Correct Answer:** b) Reducing waste and focusing on the essentials

**Explanation:**  
Lean thinking reduces waste and focuses on the essentials. In Scrum, this means eliminating activities that don't add value, keeping the framework lightweight, and focusing on what truly matters for delivering value to customers. This includes avoiding unnecessary documentation, meetings that don't serve a purpose, features that won't be used, and delays in feedback. The intentionally incomplete nature of Scrum itself reflects lean thinking - it provides just enough framework to enable empiricism without becoming burdensome with unnecessary process overhead.

---

### Question 48: Cross-functional Teams
**What does it mean for a Scrum Team to be cross-functional?**

a) Team members come from different departments  
b) Team members have all the skills necessary to create value each Sprint  
c) Team members rotate roles  
d) Team members work on multiple projects  

**Correct Answer:** b) Team members have all the skills necessary to create value each Sprint

**Explanation:**  
Cross-functional means the team members have all the skills necessary to create value each Sprint. Scrum Teams are cross-functional, meaning the members collectively have all the skills and expertise needed to do the work without depending on others not part of the team. This doesn't mean every individual has every skill, but rather that the team as a whole has what's needed. This reduces dependencies, increases agility, and enables the team to be self-managing in delivering complete Increments of value.

---

### Question 49: Sprint Goal Purpose
**What is the primary purpose of having a Sprint Goal?**

a) To create detailed task assignments  
b) To provide a single objective that provides coherence and focus  
c) To satisfy stakeholder requests  
d) To measure individual performance  

**Correct Answer:** b) To provide a single objective that provides coherence and focus

**Explanation:**  
The Sprint Goal provides a single objective for the Sprint that creates coherence and focus, encouraging the Scrum Team to work together rather than on separate initiatives. It provides guidance to the Developers on why they are building the Increment and gives the team flexibility in terms of exactly what functionality they implement during the Sprint. If the work turns out to be different than expected, the Developers collaborate with the Product Owner to negotiate the scope of the Sprint Backlog within the Sprint without affecting the Sprint Goal.

---

### Question 50: Product Backlog Refinement
**What is Product Backlog refinement?**

a) A mandatory Scrum event  
b) The act of breaking down and further defining Product Backlog items  
c) Done only by the Product Owner  
d) Scheduled once per Sprint  

**Correct Answer:** b) The act of breaking down and further defining Product Backlog items

**Explanation:**  
Product Backlog refinement is the act of breaking down and further defining Product Backlog items into smaller, more precise items. This is an ongoing activity to add details such as description, order, and size. Product Backlog items that can be Done by the Scrum Team within one Sprint are deemed ready for selection in Sprint Planning. This is not a formal Scrum event but rather an ongoing activity. The Developers who will be doing the work are responsible for the sizing, and the Product Owner can help by clarifying details.

---

### Question 51: Scrum Values in Action
**When are the Scrum values most evident?**

a) In formal documentation  
b) When embodied by the Scrum Team's work, actions, and behavior  
c) During certification exams  
d) In management reports  

**Correct Answer:** b) When embodied by the Scrum Team's work, actions, and behavior

**Explanation:**  
The Scrum values of Commitment, Focus, Openness, Respect, and Courage are most evident when they are embodied by the Scrum Team's work, actions, and behavior. These values give direction to the Scrum Team with regard to their work, actions, and behavior, but they are not simply things to read about or remember. When these values are lived by the Scrum Team and the people they work with, the empirical Scrum pillars of transparency, inspection, and adaptation come to life, building trust and creating an environment where Scrum can thrive.

---

### Question 52: Multiple Increments per Sprint
**Can multiple Increments be created within a single Sprint?**

a) No, only one Increment per Sprint  
b) Yes, multiple Increments may be created within a Sprint  
c) Only if approved by the Product Owner  
d) Only in the final Sprint  

**Correct Answer:** b) Yes, multiple Increments may be created within a Sprint

**Explanation:**  
Yes, multiple Increments may be created within a Sprint. Work cannot be considered part of an Increment unless it meets the Definition of Done. The sum of the Increments is presented at the Sprint Review, thus supporting empiricism. An Increment may be delivered to stakeholders prior to the end of the Sprint. The Sprint Review should never be considered a gate to releasing value. The ability to create and potentially release multiple Increments during a Sprint increases opportunities for feedback and value delivery.

---

### Question 53: Stakeholder Engagement
**Who is responsible for engaging with stakeholders?**

a) Only the Scrum Master  
b) Only the Product Owner  
c) The Product Owner, with support from the Scrum Master and Developers as needed  
d) An external project manager  

**Correct Answer:** c) The Product Owner, with support from the Scrum Master and Developers as needed

**Explanation:**  
While the Product Owner is primarily responsible for engaging with stakeholders and managing their expectations, they are supported by the Scrum Master and Developers as needed. The Product Owner is accountable for maximizing the value of the product, which requires understanding stakeholder needs and ensuring their input influences the Product Backlog. The Scrum Master can help facilitate stakeholder collaboration, and Developers may engage with stakeholders during Sprint Reviews or when technical clarification is needed. Effective stakeholder engagement is a team effort, though the Product Owner leads it.

---

### Question 54: Scrum Team Accountability
**To whom is the Scrum Team accountable?**

a) To senior management  
b) To themselves as a unit, for creating a valuable, useful Increment every Sprint  
c) To the Product Owner  
d) To external auditors  

**Correct Answer:** b) To themselves as a unit, for creating a valuable, useful Increment every Sprint

**Explanation:**  
The Scrum Team is accountable for creating a valuable, useful Increment every Sprint. While individuals have specific accountabilities (Product Owner for value, Developers for creating the Increment, Scrum Master for Scrum effectiveness), the entire Scrum Team is collectively accountable for creating value. They are self-managing, meaning they decide internally who does what, when, and how. This collective accountability ensures collaboration and shared responsibility for outcomes rather than finger-pointing or blame when things don't go as expected.

---

### Question 55: Impediment Removal
**Who is responsible for removing impediments?**

a) Only the Scrum Master  
b) Only management  
c) The Scrum Master causes removal of impediments; the entire team works to identify and address them  
d) Only the Developers  

**Correct Answer:** c) The Scrum Master causes removal of impediments; the entire team works to identify and address them

**Explanation:**  
The Scrum Master is accountable for causing the removal of impediments to the Scrum Team's progress. However, this doesn't mean the Scrum Master must personally remove every impediment. The entire team should work together to identify impediments, and often Developers can remove impediments themselves. The Scrum Master's role is to ensure impediments are identified, addressed, and if they're beyond the team's control, escalated appropriately. This might involve working with management, removing organizational barriers, or coaching the team to overcome challenges themselves.

---

### Question 56: Product Goal Achievement
**What happens when a Product Goal is achieved?**

a) The project ends  
b) The Scrum Team fulfills or abandons it before taking on the next objective  
c) A new Sprint begins immediately  
d) The team is disbanded  

**Correct Answer:** b) The Scrum Team fulfills or abandons it before taking on the next objective

**Explanation:**  
The Product Goal describes a future state of the product which can serve as a target for the Scrum Team to plan against. The Product Goal is in the Product Backlog, and the rest of the Product Backlog emerges to define "what" will fulfill the Product Goal. A product is a vehicle to deliver value and has a clear boundary, known stakeholders, and well-defined users or customers. The Scrum Team must fulfill (or abandon) one Product Goal before taking on the next. This focus ensures the team works toward clear objectives rather than spreading efforts across too many goals.

---

### Question 57: Scrum Theory Application
**How does Scrum optimize predictability?**

a) Through detailed upfront planning  
b) Through an iterative, incremental approach  
c) Through rigid adherence to schedules  
d) Through comprehensive documentation  

**Correct Answer:** b) Through an iterative, incremental approach

**Explanation:**  
Scrum employs an iterative, incremental approach to optimize predictability and to control risk. Rather than attempting to predict everything upfront (which is impossible for complex work), Scrum embraces uncertainty through regular inspection and adaptation cycles. Each Sprint delivers an Increment, providing concrete evidence of progress and learning. This approach allows teams to make more accurate predictions based on actual experience rather than speculation, while also enabling them to adjust course when circumstances change or new information emerges.

---

### Question 58: Quality in Scrum
**How is quality addressed in Scrum?**

a) Through a separate quality assurance team  
b) By adhering to a Definition of Done and not decreasing quality during the Sprint  
c) In a final testing phase  
d) By the Scrum Master reviewing all work  

**Correct Answer:** b) By adhering to a Definition of Done and not decreasing quality during the Sprint

**Explanation:**  
Quality in Scrum is ensured by Developers adhering to a Definition of Done. During the Sprint, no changes are made that would endanger the Sprint Goal, and quality does not decrease. The Definition of Done creates transparency by providing everyone a shared understanding of what work was completed as part of the Increment. If a Product Backlog item does not meet the Definition of Done, it cannot be released or even presented at the Sprint Review. Quality is built in throughout the Sprint, not added at the end.

---

### Question 59: Scrum Team Size Rationale
**Why does Scrum recommend teams of 10 or fewer people?**

a) To reduce salary costs  
b) To remain nimble while being large enough to complete significant work  
c) Because larger teams are always less productive  
d) To fit in one conference room  

**Correct Answer:** b) To remain nimble while being large enough to complete significant work

**Explanation:**  
The Scrum Team is small enough to remain nimble and large enough to complete significant work within a Sprint, typically 10 or fewer people. In general, smaller teams communicate better and are more productive. If Scrum Teams become too large, they should consider reorganizing into multiple cohesive Scrum Teams, each focused on the same product, sharing the same Product Goal, Product Backlog, and Product Owner. Small team size facilitates better communication, faster decision-making, and clearer accountability while still having enough capacity to deliver value.

---

### Question 60: Continuous Improvement
**How does Scrum support continuous improvement?**

a) Through annual performance reviews  
b) Through the Sprint Retrospective and ongoing inspection and adaptation  
c) Through mandatory training programs  
d) Through management directives  

**Correct Answer:** b) Through the Sprint Retrospective and ongoing inspection and adaptation

**Explanation:**  
Scrum supports continuous improvement through the Sprint Retrospective, where the team plans ways to increase quality and effectiveness, and through ongoing inspection and adaptation throughout all Scrum events. The Sprint Retrospective provides a dedicated time for the team to reflect on their process and identify improvements. However, improvement isn't limited to retrospectives - the empirical pillars of transparency, inspection, and adaptation are applied throughout Scrum, enabling the team to continuously learn and improve. The Scrum values, particularly openness and courage, support a culture of continuous improvement.
